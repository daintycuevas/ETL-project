The shown step in this screenshot is when we narrowed down the results of our main data source from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete?select=alcoholSubstanceAbuse.csv. We focused on the results for 2018 and "Both sexes" to gather data for male and female. This step also allowed us to have one specific data for each country and merge this dataframe to our second dataframe.
